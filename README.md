# FFWD to 2022

## Caveat Emptor

Welcome. This repo is a sea of probably usefull C++. But surely full of now redundant code.
This was made in days before std::print, std::format and such.
And these days we use Sheredom's UTEST and UBENCH

And above it all, I am now back to [C23](https://devclass.com/2022/08/08/c23-is-done-declares-iso-project-editor-heres-whats-new/).
